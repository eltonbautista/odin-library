# odin-library
This is a simple library that can be used to keep track of a book's title, author, number of pages, genre, and whether you have read it or not.
- This project helps me integrate the new concepts I've learned about OOP which are: Object Constructors and Prototypes.
- This project also further helps me expand on my previously learned knowledge of JS, HTML, and CSS. 

Note: As of the initial push of this project I have not yet learned about persisting information. Thus, whenever the website is reloaded all of the books added by the user will disappear. I will come back to it once I've learned about storing data(?) and add it as a feature in the future. (Local Storage(?))
